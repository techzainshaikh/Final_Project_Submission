Scenerio:
---------

- Your company's public-facing website is hosted in a local data center
- The CTO, Soham, wants to migrate the website to AWS using EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- You are asked to develop a basic, working proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate how the company could host the website on AWS EC2

Virtual private Cloud (Basics):
-------------------------------

- A VPC is a servcie that let you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network you define
- A VPC spans accorss entire region. Since each region can have multiple ASz so VPC can span accorss multiple AZs
- A Subnet is a range of IP addresses  in your VPC. Every Subnet can be assoicated with *only ONE* AZ ( i:e.,You can launch AWS servcies into specific subnets)
- A Route Table contians a set of rules, called rotues that are used to determine where network traffice from your VPC is directred.
- An Internet Gateway enables your instace to connectc with internet.

SIMPLE SETUP
-------------

Step 1:
-------

- Craete VPC -- Name -- virtual-private-cloud 
- IPv4 CIDR --> 10.0.0.9/16
- Host address range --> 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.255.254 (255 broadcasting)

Step 2:
-------

- Create subnet --> 10.0.1.0/24
- Host address range --> 10.0.1.1 - 10.0.1.254 (255 broadcasting)

Step 3:
------

- Create Internet Gateway and attached it with VPC.
- Enable your Route table to connect with internet usinfg 0.0.0.0/0

Step 4:
-------

- Launch an EC2 Machine with your specified VPC (virtual-private-cloud)
- Try SSH

---------------------------------
SETUP WITH PUBLIC/PRIVATE SUBNETS
---------------------------------

Step 1:
-------
- Cretae VPC -- Name -- virtual-private-cloud
- IPv4 CIDR -- 10.0.0.0/16
- Host address range -- 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.255.254 (255 broadcasting)

Step 2:
-------
Create 2 subnets (Public & Private)

- Public-Subnet-A--10.0.0.0/24
- Host address range -- 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.254

- Private-Subnet-B--10.0.1.0/24
- Host address range -- 10.0.1.1 - 10.0.1.254

Step 3:
-------
Check the default route table -- you will see the above 2 subnets have not been explicitly associated with any route tables and are therefore associated with the main route table.

Step 4:
-------
Create a IGW & connect with VPC

Step 5:
-------
Create 2 route tables -- one with Public IGW , one private(only local)
--public-route--add IGW in route table & associate the public subnet
--private-route -- associate the private subnet

Step 6:
-------
Create one EC2 instance in Public Subnet  (autoassign Public IP enable)
Create one EC2 instance in Private Subnet (SSH & ICMP from Public Subnet)

Note:
-----
ICMP--Internet Control Message Protocol--used to perform network diagnostics
scp -i ~/Downloads/my-key.pem index.html ec2-user@54.201.123.45:/home/ec2-user/

Step 7:
------
Ping the Private EC2 from public EC2
Ping Google.com from public EC2

Step 8:
-------
Send the Pem file via Winscp to public ec2.

Use that key to enter in private EC2

----------------------
NAT GATEWAY IN DEPTH
----------------------

- To access the internet one publiuc IP address is needed, but we can use a prviate IP address in our private network.
- The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the internet through single public address.
- To achieve this, the translation of a private IP address to a public IP address is required.

- NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION: is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global 
IP address and vice versa to provide internet access to local hosts.

- Internet Gateway allows instace with public IP to access internet.
- NAt Gateway allow instace with NO public IP to access internet.

Steps:
------
- Create NAT GATEWAY and attach elastic IP with it.
- Attach NAT gateway to public rotue table that have access to internet
- 0.0.0.0/0 traffic throught nat gatway NAT gateway will be moved now.

NOTE:
- delete NAT Gateway
- release Elastic IP
- remove access fron Private rotue table

----------------------
VPC ENDPOINT IN DEPTH
----------------------

- A VPC endpoint enables connections between vitual private cloud (vpc) and supported services, without 
requiring that you use a internet gateway, NAT device etc

NOTE: services should be in same region.

Steps:
------
- create role fro ec2 to have s3 access
- attach role to ec2
- create endpoint for vpc (private routetable should be selected)
- aws s3 ls s3://s3-stock-prices-qh
